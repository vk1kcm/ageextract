# ageextract.py

A python script to breakout FIE XML into age categories and results.

Since we're not a large state, our age tournaments are quite small, and it's pretty much impossible to get enough fencers in each age group to run an event.  So, we pool them together into one big event, which is typically run as two rounds of poules, and then separate them out into age rankings from the final results.

Our competition rules state, that eligibility for a age group is based on your age at the beginning of the year.  Also, we don't use exact birthdays anymore, for some small privacy protection, and instead use a birthdate of 1/1/\<year>.  Both of these assumptions are hardcoded in.
